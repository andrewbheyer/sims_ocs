    :header-rows: 1

    * -  Column
      -  Description
    * -  targetId
      -  Numeric identifier for a particular target request.
    * -  Session_sessionId
      -  The simulation run session Id.
    * -  Field_fieldId
      -  Numeric identifier that relates to an entry in the Field table.
    * -  filter
      -  Band filter requested by the target.
    * -  requestTime
      -  The UTC time (units=seconds) when all of the associated information (airmass etc.) was calculated for the target.
    * -  requestMJD
      -  The Modified Julian Date (units=seconds) when all of the associated information (airmass etc.) was calculated for the target.
    * -  ra
      -  Right Ascension of the requested target (units=degrees).
    * -  dec
      -  Declination of the requested target (units=degrees).
    * -  angle
      -  Difference between parallactic angle and rotator angle (units=degrees).
    * -  numExposures
      -  Number of exposures for the requested target.
    * -  requestedExpTime
      -  The total duration of all requested exposures (units=seconds).
    * -  airmass
      -  The airmass of the target.
    * -  skyBrightness
      -  The calculated skybrightness for the target.
    * -  slewTime
      -  The calculated slew time (units=seconds) for the target.
    * -  costBonus
      -  The calculated cost bonus (slew time) for the target.
    * -  rank
      -  The rank of the target for the associated proposal. If more than one proposal, this is a coadded value.
    * -  propBoost
      -  The calculated time-balancing boost for the target.
    * -  numRequestingProps
      -  The total number of proposals requesting this target. More than one means the target was in each proposals winner's list.
    * -  moonRA
      -  The right-ascension (units=degrees) of the moon.
    * -  moonDec
      -  The declination (units=degrees) of the moon.
    * -  moonAlt
      -  The altitude (units=degrees) of the moon.
    * -  moonAz
      -  The azimuth (units=degrees) of the moon.
    * -  moonDistance
      -  The distance (units=degrees) between the moon and the target.
    * -  moonPhase
      -  The phase of the moon.
    * -  sunRA
      -  The right-ascension (units=degrees) of the sun.
    * -  sunDec
      -  The declination (units=degrees) of the sun.
    * -  sunAlt
      -  The altitude (units=degrees) of the sun.
    * -  sunAz
      -  The azimuth (units=degrees) of the sun.
    * -  sunElong
      -  The elongation (units=degrees) of the sun.
