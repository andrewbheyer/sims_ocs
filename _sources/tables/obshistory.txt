ObsHistory
==========

This table keeps a record of each visit made by the observatory during a simulated survey. Multiple proposals can be associated with a single visit leading to duplicate entries in this table.

    :header-rows: 1

    * -  Column
      -  Description
    * -  observationId
      -  Numeric identifier for an observation entry.
    * -  Session_sessionId
      -  The simulation run session Id.
    * -  night
      -  The night in the survey for the observation. Starts from 1.
    * -  observationStartTime
      -  The UTC start time for the observation (units=seconds). This occurs after the slew but before the first exposure.
    * -  observationStartMJD
      -  The Modified Julian Date at observation start (units=seconds).
    * -  observationStartLST
      -  The Local Sidereal Time at observation start (units=degrees)
    * -  TargetHistory_targetId
      -  Numeric identifier that relates to an entry in the TargetHistory entry.
    * -  Field_fieldId
      -  Numeric identifier that relates to an entry in the Field table.
    * -  filter
      -  The one character name for the band filter.
    * -  ra
      -  The Right Ascension of the observation (units=degrees).
    * -  dec
      -  The Declination of the observation (units=degrees).
    * -  angle
      -  The Position Angle of the observation (units=degrees).
    * -  numExposures
      -  The number of exposures taken for the observation.
    * -  visitTime
      -  The total time for the observation (units=seconds) including exposure, shutter and readout time.
    * -  visitExposureTime
      -  The sum of all the exposure times for the observation (units=seconds). No shutter and readout time included.
