Simulated Observatory Control System
======================================

This repository contains the code and data necessary for the Simulated 
Observatory Control System (SOCS) software. It is designed to simulate enough 
of the LSST Observatory Control System (OCS) to run the LSST Scheduler. 
Collectively, the SOCS and Scheduler are called version 4 of the Operations Simulator 
(OpSim).
